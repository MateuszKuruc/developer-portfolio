# developer-portfolio

<p>The goal of this project was to build a modern website that will act as my developer portfolio. The site presents my profile, experience and projects I worked on.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>My aim was to make a portfolio website that will serve a few purposes simultaneously. My considerations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It should show my skills in a concise way and make it easy for people to contact me</li>
  <li>The website needs to prove that I know what I am doing as developer, so smooth experience without hiccups is a must</li>
  <li>Although I am not a designer, I wanted the app to have a unique, but <b>not overwhelming</b> style</li>
  <li>Building this site should teach me something, since I am still developing as a programmer</li>
</ul>

<p>The app is built with <b>Next.js</b> to easily handle routes, keep simple project structure and handle backend requests when needed. For increased type safety and for training purposes, <b>TypeScript</b> was used throughout the whole app. Styling was done with <b>Tailwind CSS</b> due to convenience and developer experience. Animations and page transitions handled by <b>Framer Motion</b>.
<p>Looking at the final results, I believe that I achieved all the key points.</p>
